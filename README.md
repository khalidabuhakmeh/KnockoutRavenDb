KnockoutRavenDb
===============

Todo List implementation using RavenDB and Knockout. Yes this is another Todo List, but I just created it to try to wrap my head around KnockoutJs. I also put it here so others could see how I was doing it (might not be the best way).

I made some design choices that make sense for a quick demo, but might not be the best experience for a task list. If you want to make it better, please send me a pull request.

Requirements
----------------

- Visual Studio 2012
- NuGet & NuGet Package Restore

Pull the project down and run it. It should work right away.
